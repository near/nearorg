## Getting Started

This project requires Node 20. If you use `nvm`, simply run:

```bash
nvm install
nvm use
```

This project requires [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation) version `9.1.1`. The strict version requirement will help keep our lockfile consistent as more developers contribute. Make sure you have the correct version of `pnpm` installed:

```bash
pnpm -v # This should output 9.1.1
npm install -g pnpm@9.1.1 # Install the correct version if needed
```

Install all dependencies and run the dev server:

```bash
pnpm i
pnpm dev
```
